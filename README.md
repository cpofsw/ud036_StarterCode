# Movie Trailers Website Project

This is a movie trailers website project for Udacity Web Full Stack course.

## Project Overview

This project tested my Python skills to create a class Movie and a method which
I could use to make a movies list and turn it on a trailer website. The extension
of my work goes until providing the list of Movies and it's instances. The website
conversion is completed by a provided file (fresh_tomatoes.py).

## How it works

The class Movie and it's object and method can be found on media.py file. After
the class Movie was defined I've created a list o Movies (objects of Movie) on
entertainement_center.py file. To make your own list of movies, you need to
change the entertainement_center.py file. After you provide your own list, the
fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies) will generate the website. It's important
to remember that you can also change the atrributes you may want to show about the
movies using the media.py file, where the atrributes for the class Movie are.
